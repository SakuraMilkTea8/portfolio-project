          <p>
            I grew using French and English at home in MontrÃ©al, Canada. I used
            French academically until I graduated high school, so until then I
            consider my dominant language to have been French. I then moved to
            Toronto for 5 years for university, where the language of education
            was English, and became fully bilingual. After graduating university
            I moved straight to Japan on the JET Programme, and taught English
            in various public schools for the past 5 years. I lived in Joetsu
            city, Niigata prefecture for two years, and then moved to Tokyo
            where I am still located. Joetsu was beautiful and very remote,
            rightfully dubbed "snow country" for it's shocking amount of
            snowfall compared with the rest of Japan. I have my Japanese
            driver's license and drove my own car while living there, and keep
            the memories of my time living between rice fields fondly in my
            heart. In Tokyo, I currently work at an IB-accredited public high
            school where I teach high-level English classes such as translation
            and literature. Life in Tokyo is very different from Joetsu, but
            very exciting. Currently being trilingual Fr/Eng/Jp, languages have
            always fascinated me, and I've always enjoyed learning them.
            Programming was no different, and after becoming comfortable with
            Japanese enough to live in Japan I began studying coding slowly on
            the side as a hobby. After finally finishing off paying my
            university student loans last year while studying Japanese and
            coding on my own, I am making the jump in March 2022 and formally
            beginning my academic programming journey with a bootcamp at LeWagon
            Tokyo!
