This is the first application I have built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JS, and two different APIs. It's a weather app with real-time updates, and matching little weather emoji! Everything I have written to build it is open-source, so feel free to go take a look at my code.
<br />
However, because it is built using vanilla HTML without the use of any responsive building features, the app unfortunately doesn't fare very well on smaller screens, so please be warned if you are opening this on mobile~!

          <h2>And streaming...</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
I started streaming for fun in 2019, just a bit before what-shall-not-be-named began. The idea came from a desire to share my love of video games, and to find like-minded people to talk to! I can confidently say that streaming boosted my self-confidence, and made me more comfortable talking to new people. When isolation measures began, streaming became my main source of public interaction, and really helped me stay sane (lol).

As of writing this, I have reached the affiliate status, a growing community of wholesome and friendly individuals [1.4k and counting!], and created a Discord server where the discussions go way beyond gaming. We even have a channel for coding-related discussions!

          <h2>And many other things!</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
I've always been a fan of figuring out how things work, and customizing the looks of what I own to better fit my preferences (peek this website's color scheme!).
Beside building my own PC after coming to Japan, I have also recently discovered an interest in electrical soldering. My most recent work (pictured here) involved bypassing the region lock of my Japanese GameCube in order to play North American games on it. My previous experience with region-freeing was with a N64, and the bypass only involved physical changes to the plastic socket inside the console. The GameCube bypass was a lot more interesting in that it involved soldering two points of the motherboard together in order to short-circuit the region lock. I added a small switch between the wires to be able to revert the modification and go between playing Japanese or North American games at my leisure.
Other projects I've worked on this year were repairing my very old, very overheated laptop, and changing the shell of both my and my friend's Switch consoles to our prefered custom color. Feel free to ask me about them‚ò∫Ô∏é!
